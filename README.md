# 🏥 Hospital Data Analysis: Operational, Financial, and Clinical Insights Using Excel

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing hospital performance using a dataset of 1,000+ patient records. The goal is to uncover operational inefficiencies, financial patterns, clinical insights, and patient outcome trends. The analysis was performed entirely in **Microsoft Excel**, leveraging PivotTables, charts, slicers, and formulas.

The project delivers insights into departmental efficiency, cost of care, recovery trends, insurance impact, and patient satisfaction across multiple hospitals and cities.
